## 💼 Projects

### [Basement probe](https://github.com/ZONDE00)
Project mission is to carry out UV measurements, in order to estimate the density of ozone molecules in atmosphere depending on altitude. In addition the sub-objective is to upgrade current communication subsystem from simplex to half duplex. Thus allowing to send commands to probe from ground base station. It is required, to ensure user controlled probe - detachment from balloon to control probes travel distance. My task is to oversee development - integration of subsystems, overall system design, test and verification management and ensuring half-duplex communication with radio-amateur support telemetry.
